# About the Data

The dataset from which the analysis below was done was obtained from the [Flavors of Cacao](http://flavorsofcacao.com/index.html) site and is also available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/chocolate-bar-ratings).

The dataset contains almost 1800 expert ratings of various chocolate bars from different types of cocoa beans, origins, companies and manufacturing countries. Each rating also contains additional information about the specific bean origin (if known) and information about the percentage of cocoa.

Chocolates were evaluated between 2006 and 2017 on a scale of 1 to 5:

1. Unpleasant
2. Disappointing 
3. Satisfactory (3.0) to praiseworthy (3.75)
4. Premium 
5. Elite 

The rating is a combination of both objective qualities and subjective interpretation.
